Compare two files:
```commandline
midiff --diff a.mid b.mid
```

Configure VS Code as diff tool

```

### Documentation

```commandline
usage: midiff [-h] [--diff DIFF DIFF]
              [--configure-difftool CONFIGURE_DIFFTOOL]

positional arguments:
  repo                  Path to the git repository

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --diff DIFF DIFF      Provide the path to 2 midi files and compare them.
  --configure-difftool CONFIGURE_DIFFTOOL
                        Give the diff tool command to use to compare files
                        with `$1` and `$2` as placeholders for the two files
                        you want to compare. Current diff tool is: `diff $1 $2`.
  --configure-clear CONFIGURE_CLEAR
                        Set to false if you want to remove the temporary files
                        when midiff is done. Clearing the files may cause
                        problems on asynchronous diff tools such as VS Code.
                        Currently set to true.
